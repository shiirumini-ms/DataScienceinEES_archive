# Instructions for Assessment 1 - Clean That Code!

This assessment is FORMATIVE, but important to your development on this course, helpful for future weeks, and gets you used to assessment repos. Ignore it at your peril!!

## Key Info
1. Clean that Code! (see 'Full Instructions')
2. Be finished by end of play Tuesday 7th, leaving time for feedback...
3. Also by the end of that Tuesday, make sure you add your 'Providing Feedback' partner to your repo (See 'Feedback List')
4. From Wednesday 8th, go to your 'Recieving Feedback' partner's repo and give feedback either by 'pulling' and commenting code directly, or by making an issue in the repo (what makes good feedback? Kind, constructive, gives positives alongside negatives, specific!). See if you can learn things you missed too.
5. Feedback and final edits due midday Friday 10th Oct, when the repos will freeze!
6. After this we'll release the full list of corrections, a prize for anyone that discovers efficiences we didn't

## Full Instructions

We are on the theme of data wrangling. Often in science and particularly in the world of data science you will be asked to review and contribute to other people’s code or to build on existing code and improve it. We have set up this assessment to replicate this process.

This is a repository with data and a functioning `R` script. We have purposely written this code to be inefficient and a bit hard to follow. It's an example of not particularly brilliant programming - though the script does currently work! Your challenge is to make the code better - more efficient, better structured, tidier, clearer, and to produce and save the more finalised data outputs, including saved data objects and figures. No need to add any datasets or improving the statistical analyses, instead stick with what we have provided and focus on making the code itself better. Bonus points if you also make the repo more organised, edit this readme to tailor to yourself etc!  

Finally, this will be peer assessed. Each of you are being asked to provide feedback on a fellow students work - the student whose work you will provide feedback on is listed in the table below. At the end we'll release a list of all the ways the code could've been improved, and you can see how well you did!

## Feedback List:

IMPORTANT - you must invite the 'Providing Feedback' person you are assigned to to you repo so they can see your work! In the top left go to "Settings" --> "Collaborators and Teams" (high up in the menu on the left) then under "Manage Access" click "Add People". Type the name NOT in brackets below, and click them. (You can have a different user name and 'main name', hence the brackets, most people have used the same for both)
