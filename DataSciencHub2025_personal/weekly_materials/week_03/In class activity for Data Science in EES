# Instructions ----

# To answer your question you need to use a pipe and dplyr functions. You can also use other functions. Here is a list of the dplyr functions:

# https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/

# Before you start coding, you need to draw a work flow diagram in a file, on paper or a white board for how you are going to design your code. Then you need to take a screen cap/photo of that diagram and upload it to the folder for this activity.

# Then you need to translate your workflow diagram into comments in the R code.

# Then you can start coding.
