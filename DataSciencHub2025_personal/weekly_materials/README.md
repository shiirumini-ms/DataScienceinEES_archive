# Flipped Classroom At Home Activities
In addition to the 'In Class' weekly resources given in the folders in this repo (as you see above), we have here a collection of all of the resources sent out for each week - we expect you to spend time working on these, _you will struggle to keep up in class if you don't_.
At minimum you should work through at least one of either the Data Camp or Coding Club tutorials for the week. If you find you prefer Data Camp, still refer to Coding Club tutorials occasionally to get familiar, as you'll be expected to emulate one of these for the Tutorial assessment. Try and have a skim of the readings too, and spend more time on anything you find helpful.

## Week 1
- Data Camp Assignment
    - Introduction to R
- Coding Club Tutorials
    - [Intro to R Part 1](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/intro-to-r/)
    - [Intro to R Part 2 (Troubleshooting)](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/troubleshooting/)
-	Extra Reading
    - [Wikipedia about R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language))
    - [Article about Functional vs. Object-Oriented Programming](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/functional-programming-vs-object-oriented-programming) (we are doing object-oriented programming!)

## Week 2
For this week, we need you to do _both_ the Data Camp and Coding Club tutorials (at least the first part of Data Camp)
- Coding Club Tutorial (IMPORTANT THIS WEEK)
    - [Intro to git and version control](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/git/)
- Data Camp Assignment
    - Reporting with R Markdown
- Extra Reading
    - Extra Task: Reproducibility Challenge (see 'Issues')

## Week 3

For this week, please at least read through the Coding Club tutorials to understand some of the rationale (e.g. Long vs Wide format data, extended pipes) - but then practice your skills using Data Camp. 
- Coding Club Tutorials
    - [Basic data manipulation in R](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/data-manip-intro/)
    - [Efficient data manipulation in R](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/data-manip-efficient/)
    - Optional Extra: [Coding Etiquette](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/etiquette/)
- Data Camp Assignment
    - Data Manipulation with dplyr (priority on Chapters 1-3)
- Extra Reading
    - [R Studio Cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) - this are super helpful, many a data scientist has them printed and stuck on the wall!
    - [The TidyVerse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
    - [R for Data Science Chapter 5 Data transformation](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html)
    - [R for Data Science Part II Wrangle Chapters 9 - 16](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/wrangle-intro.html)

## Week 4
- Data Camp Assignment
    - Introduction to Data Visualisation with ggplot2
- Coding Club tutorials
    - [Beautiful and informative data visualisation in R](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/datavis)
    - [Customising your figures](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/data-vis-2/)
- Readings
    - [R for Data Science Chapter 3 Data visualisation](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html])
    - [R for Data Science Chapter 28 Graphics for communication](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/graphics-for-communication.html)

## Note 
Weeks 5-8 cover linear models and extensions. The way we teach doesn't perfectly map on to tutorials, so you'll find we don't cover model interpretation until later in the day, and Week 7 tutorials cover Mixed models when we cover that in class in Week 6. Stick wtih them anyway! It'll all help reinforce your learining. 

## Week 5 
Please do at least one of either: Data Camp, Coding Club, or Frans Rodenburg's incredible videos/tutorial (a bonus for linear modelling related content!). Ideally don't only rely on the Coding Club, this will give you the least preparation.
- Data Camp Assignment
    - Introduction to Regression in R (CHAPTERS 1-3 ONLY)
- Coding Club Tutorials
    - [Modelling](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/modelling/)
- Frans Rodenburg's Tutorial
    - I recently discovered this guy in Germany who is producing *amazingly clear* content about linear models. Try watching the videos [at this link](https://fransrodenburg.github.io/Applied-Statistics/simplelinearregression.html), if you find it clear then rather than doing Data Camp/Coding Club, watch all his vids and do his quiz etc. 
- Readings
    - Graph Pad [“The Ultimate Guide to Linear Regression”](https://www.graphpad.com/guides/the-ultimate-guide-to-linear-regression) (start here if everything else bamboozles you, it’s code free and they explain things great!)
 
## Week 6 
- Data Camp Assignment
    - Generalised Linear Models in R
-	Coding Club Tutorials
    - None
- Readings
    - Tim Newbold’s [excellent blog](https://timnewbold.github.io/teaching_resources/GLMs.html) about GLMs

## Week 7 
- Data Camp Assignment
    - Hierarchical and Mixed Effects Models in R (CHAPTERS 1-3 ONLY)
- Coding Club Tutorials
    - NA
- Readings
    - Tim Newbold’s [excellent blog](https://timnewbold.github.io/teaching_resources/MixedEffectsModels.html) about Mixed Effects models

## Week 8
NO DATA CAMP, CODING CLUB OR EXTRA READING (Good luck finishing the WWF Report!)

## Week 9 
- Coding Club Tutorial (the only thing this week!)
    - [Google Earth Engine](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/earth-engine/)

## Week 10
- Data Camp Assignment (the only thing this week!)
    - Building Web Applications with Shiny in R

## Data Camp Extras for Keen Beans
- Intermediate R
- Intermediate Data Vis with ggplot2
- Case Studies: Building Web Applications with Shiny in R
