# Data Science Hub 2025

This is the repository for the 2025 Data Science in Ecology and Environmental Science course. Welcome!

You'll see that the repo contains folders for weekly content. Some of these need to be updated, this'll happen as the course goes along. You as the student can edit this repo (sometimes we want you to add files to folders etc), but try not to add files or delete folders in weird places.

When looking at the main repo, you have file names or folders on the left, and then details about the latest edits to them in the middle column (which is just whatever someone happens to writes), and when those edits were made on the right. To open files or folders, click on their name on the left. To download files, after you click on their name, you'll see a 'download' arrow button to the top right.

# Questions, Queries, Concerns

If you have any questions about the course, please add them as a new Issue in the 'Issues' tab (you can see it in the menu bar at the top of the repo).

# Course Info
You can see and download the [Course Handbook](CourseHandBook_ECSC10038_DataScienceInEES_2025-26.pdf) from the repo above. The course administrator is Ms. Francesca Nadal Finnegan ([Francesca.Finnegan\@ed.ac.uk](mailto:Francesca.Finnegan@ed.ac.uk)), who you should contact for any admin issues, or to request extensions. The Course Organiser is Dr. Hannah Wauchope ([hannah.wauchope\@ed.ac.uk](mailto:hannah.wauchope@ed.ac.uk)), who you should contact for specific personal issues, but if they're questions about course content or assessment etc, try and keep them to the issues tab (that way others can see the answer).

# Assessment Reminder:

This course has 1 formative and 3 summative assessment pieces. Remember that for all summative work we mark both your Learn submission *and* the assignment Github Repo. Ensure your repo is ready by the deadline (when Github will take an automatic snapshot - you don't have to do anyting more) and that you have also submitted the relevant item to Learn. THIS IS CRUCIAL - YOU WILL FAIL IF YOU DON'T AND WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO GIVE SPECIAL DISPENSATION.

Assessment Pieces:

1. Clean-That-Code (We first have a formative assessment for you to practice coding skills development)
2. WWF Report - about the population trends of a chosen species. Due AT THIS TIME (submit report to Learn, but ensure repo is ready for github snapshot at the deadline - we will mark this too).
3. Tutorial - on a subject of your choice. Due AT THIS TIME (include the link to your tutorial at the start of the document containing your reflective piece!).
4. Reflective Piece - a short reflective essay about what you've learnt on this course. Due at the SAME TIME as the tutorial (submit to Learn, remember to include your tutorial link!).

See the [course handbook](CourseHandBook_ECSC10038_DataScienceInEES_2025-26.pdf) for full marking rubrics for each assessment. Full details will be released at the dates given in the 'Course Schedule' of the handbook.

# Oh, And...

-   Some of this course has evolved out of [Coding Club tutorials](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/), some of which are included in your flipped classroom weekly materials. There are some great ones here that we don't recommend, but some that are a little off - plotting and especially plotting maps are outdated, and there are some slightly funky things going on in the linear modelling tutorials! If confused, ask in the issues tab

-   There are [Extra resources](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/DataScienceHub2024/tree/main/extra_resources) in the repo - these contain things you might find helpful, like R cheatsheets
