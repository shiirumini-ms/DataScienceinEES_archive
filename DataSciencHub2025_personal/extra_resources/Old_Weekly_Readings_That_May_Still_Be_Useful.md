The following is from an older iteration of the Data Science course. We've changed the structure and teach some different things now. However, there's still a lot of helpful content here so I've left it for anyone that may wnat to go digging!

Readings - a history of bayesian modelling:
- The Reverend Thomas Bayes - the person who came up with Bayes Theorem - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bayes
- Richard Price - the person who wrote the paper on Bayes Theorem from the journals and notes of Thomas Bayes - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Price
- Pierre-Simon Labplace - the person who developed much of the mathematics behind Bayes Theorem - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace

- Here is the cool website where you can visualise Bayes Theorem: - https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/bayesian-inference/index.html
- Here is one more video you can check out to see if you are naturally a Bayesian or frequentist (it is quite philosophical and I am not sure I totally agree with it all, but perhaps it is still interesting to watch):
