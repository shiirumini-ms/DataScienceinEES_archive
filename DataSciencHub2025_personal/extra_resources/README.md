# Extra Resources

This is a folder for additional resources (e.g. links, videos, misc) that might help you in your data science journey.

The R Cheatsheets are particularly useful (many a coder has them printed and stuck on their wall).

This is a collaborative folder! If you find anything at all that helps you along, feel free to add it to one of the files, or start a new one of your own. When you do, make an issue in the issues tab to let others know you've engaged!
