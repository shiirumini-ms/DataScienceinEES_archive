\## Instructions for Assessment 3 - Tutorial (40% of Grade)

## R Tutorial: Working with Nested Data set - build multiple models Materials

Here is the tutorial repository created to

In this assignment you will create your own web tutorial. Your tutorial
has to communicate a specific quantitative skill - you can choose the
level at which you pitch your tutorial and how advanced or introductory
it is, but **you should aim for it to be something that would teach a
student who has taken this course something new**. Structure your
tutorial similar to the Coding Club tutorials we have referenced at
times in this course. There's considerable flexibility here and no word
limit, but you should have 3-5 learning objectives, each taking \~10
minutes for someone following at home to work through. For full guidance
see the marking criteria, and examples, given below.

**The deadline for this challenge is 12pm on 28th November 2025.**

You build your tutorial in straight markdown (.md) rather than RMarkdown
(.rmd). I STRONGLY recommend you follow all the *Useful Links* below to
help you out with this!

## Submission Format

~~We will mark your tutorial *as a website*, acting as if we were
someone actually taking the tutorial. To have your work ready in the
right format, follow these steps:~~

1.  ~~Create your tutorial in the markdown file called 'index.md'.~~
2.  ~~Now, in your repo, go to settings (top bar) and click on Pages (in
    the left options panel).~~
3.  ~~Ignore what is says under 'Source'. Under 'Branch' change 'none'
    to 'master' (if you've put the 'index.md' file within a folder in
    your repo, specify that folder with the next button, otherwise it
    should say '(root)').~~
4.  ~~Click save. Ignore the Caution that appears at the top of the
    page.~~
5.  ~~Wait a couple of mins for github to update, then in your web
    browser go to
    <https://eddatascienceees.github.io/NAME-OF-YOUR-TUTORIAL-REPO/>
    (replacing that last bit with whatever your repo is titled).
    Voila!~~
6.  ~~As you create your tutorial, you can see how edits look by just
    going to the link. This can sometimes be slow to update, esp with
    images. Wait at least 20mins before panicking that something is
    showing wrong.~~

~~When you're done, **include this link at the start of your Reflective
Piece (You can just have a word doc that opens with "Tutorial Link: ..."
before a new heading for "Reflective Piece"; Instructions for the
Reflective Piece are in the Issues Tab of the Course Repo), which you
should submit to Learn at the same due date as this tutorial.**~~

~~We will only mark the structure/content of this repo if you refer to
it in your tutorial (this is often necessary to provide data or code for
someone to follow along at home). If you haven't linked to the repo we
expect to see other ways in which you have provided means for someone
taking your tutorial to follow along.~~

~~You are encouraged to add your peers to your tutorial development
repositories so that you can exchange feedback - remember that the best
way to check if your tutorial makes sense is to have someone that is not
you go through it.~~

## Marking criteria

You will be marked according to three criteria:

\- Topic and Structure (20%)

:   Have you picked an appropriate, cohesive topic, with the right
    number of learning objectives?

\- Content (40%)

:   Have you written clearly and with good structure, have you explained
    concepts clearly, can the reader follow along easily with access to
    all data/code etc?

\- Creativity (40%)

:   Have you made full use of the web format, markdown, and images to
    produce a tutorial that is visually attractive, and teaches in
    creative ways?

See the [Marking Rubric](Tutorial_MarkingRubric.jpg) included in this
repo for full details. This is what we mark to, so pay attention!!
